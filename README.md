# CS-465

In this project I went from many step to step that included quite a few processes. I used MeanStack to complete this project mean Express.JS, Anguler.JS, MongoDB, and Node was all used to tie everything
together. Utilizing these programs JavaScript was able to be the main language to comunicate in both front and backend development. A database was still needed to store data so MongoDB was utilized for this
purpase because of the way it is able to work well with the other programs.

Within the project we were able to use JSON files to pre write some data that would eventually be added to the database. Using Javascript were were able to minupulate how some of this data was displayed
on the website as well as us JavaScript to create functions to add or edit more data. One example of this minupulation is how by default the trip cards stacked and we minupulated it so they would reside 
side by side. This allowed the site to be more visually appealing to the user.

This course has helped me understand more than just what the course is meant to teach. My personal computer has had many difficulties with the assignment and I had to keep finding ways to fix it all.
In a professional stand point, I know this is not the last time I will have to face this. This course allowed me to learn alot in the feild as well. Alot of these programs I never used before. I also havn't
used JavaScript previouse makeing this a brand new experience for me. I'm sure this knowledge will be helpful to be in the future.
